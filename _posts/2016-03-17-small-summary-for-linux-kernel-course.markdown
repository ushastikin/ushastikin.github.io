We continued/started with building our own module 'mymodule'. Here are some useful things i have learned/recalled:

* 'dmesg' prints all the kernel messages stored in the buffer
* 'printk' prints a kernel message to the console and it's messages can be seen in /var/log/messages (as all kernel logs)
* 'su -' gives root permissions and defines a full root's environment include /sbin direcroy as well (for running insmod and other commands)
* afterward i have missed some stuff about '/proc', since i started to write this blog :)
*

By the way, if you want to update this page by yourself, tell me and i will collaborate it with you.
