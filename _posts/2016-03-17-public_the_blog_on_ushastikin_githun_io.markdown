To make this blog always accessible, I have pushed it to the GitHub - [ushastikin.github.io](http://ushastikin.github.io) (according to [https://community.nitrous.io/tutorials/how-to-host-your-blog-for-free-on-github-pages](https://community.nitrous.io/tutorials/how-to-host-your-blog-for-free-on-github-pages) without using gh-pages branch).
